# Enzymatic reactions on a surface, by Steve Andrews, October 2009.
# This model is in the public domain.  Units are microns and seconds.
# The model was published in Andrews (2012) Methods for Molecular Biology, 804:519.
# It executes a Michaelis-Menten reaction within and on the surface of a 2D circle.
